# Animation
## animation-name: This property specifies the name of the keyframe animation you want to apply to an element.
- **Example: animation-name: myAnimation;**

## animation-duration: Sets the duration of the animation in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms).
- **Example: animation-duration: 2s;**

## animation-timing-function: Defines the timing function that determines the acceleration and deceleration of the animation.
- **Common values include ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, and more.**
- **Example: animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;**

## animation-delay: Specifies a delay before the animation starts. It can be in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms).
- **Example: animation-delay: 1s;**

## animation-iteration-count: Sets the number of times the animation should repeat. You can use values like infinite, 3, or 2n (for even iterations).
- **Example: animation-iteration-count: infinite;**

## animation-direction: Determines whether the animation runs forwards, backward, or alternates between forward and backward cycles.
- **Values include normal, reverse, alternate, and alternate-reverse.**
- **Example: animation-direction: alternate;**

# Very Important 
- **@keyframes:**
- **This is not a property but a rule used to define the animation's keyframes. Keyframes specify how the element should look at various points during the animation.**

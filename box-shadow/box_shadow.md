# BOX SHADOW
- **CSS3 Box Shadow is a new property to add shadow effects to any html Element. You can choose your own  offset, blur, color, spread/density and repetition. Unlike border, it not a part of CSS Box Model, thus 
doesn't effect the layout even if it is bigger in size. Also we can add multiple shadows with different colors and offsets.**
- **Outer Box Shadow: Default box shadow is outer. x-offset and y-offset are compulsory properties, rest all are optional.**
- **Inner Box Shadow: To use inner box shadow, use inset. Inset is only required if shadow is inside. By-default shadow is outside.**

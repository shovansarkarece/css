- **The position property in CSS is used to control the positioning of elements within a web page.**
- **It defines how an element should be placed relative to its normal position in the document flow or relative to its parent or containing elements.**
### Position: relative; 
-- **If we want to move our child dev anywhere then keep that child div into parent div and always parent must be relative and child must be absolute.**

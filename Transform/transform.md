## transform: translate()
- **The translate() function is used to move an element along the X and Y axes within its containing block.**
- **It takes two values: one for horizontal translation (X-axis) and one for vertical translation (Y-axis).**
## translate(x, y) - Moves the element by x units horizontally and y units vertically.  */

## transform: scale()
- **The scale() function takes one or two values**
## scale(x) - Scales the element by a factor of x along both the X and Y axes. A value of 1 is the original size, values greater than 1 make it larger, and values less than 1 make it smaller.
- **scale(x, y) - Scales the element by a factor of x along the X-axis and y along the Y-axis. You can use different values for horizontal and vertical scaling.**

## transform: rotate()
- **The rotate() function takes one parameter**
## rotate(angle) - Specifies the angle of rotation in degrees. Positive values rotate clockwise, and negative values rotate counterclockwise. */
## skew() method skews an element along the X and Y-axis by the given angles.
- **We can use this to create visually interesting effects, such as tilting or slanting elements.**

>The transform-origin property in CSS allows you to specify the point around which a transformation should occur.
>>It determines the origin point for transformation functions like rotate, scale, skew, and translate.
>>>Understanding how transform-origin works is crucial for controlling the position and behavior of transformed elements.

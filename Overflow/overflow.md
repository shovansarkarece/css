# OVERFLOW IN CSS

- **The overflow property in CSS is used to control how content overflows its containing element when it doesn't fit within the available space. It's a useful property for handling content that exceeds its container's dimensions.**

/*? Overflow: Visible (Default): This is the default behavior where content can overflow its container without any clipping. Use it when you want content to extend beyond its container's boundaries.  */

/* .container {   overflow: visible; } */

/*? Overflow: Hidden: */
/* Content that overflows the container is hidden and not visible. */
/* Useful when you want to hide extra content that doesn't fit within a fixed-size container. */

/* .container {   overflow: hidden; } */

/*? Overflow: Scroll: */
/* Scrollbars (both horizontal and vertical) are added to the container, allowing users to scroll to see the hidden content. */
/* Use it when you want to display all content and provide a scrolling mechanism. */

/* .container {  overflow: scroll; } */

/*? Overflow: Auto: */

/* Scrollbars are added only when content overflows the container. */
/* It's a combination of visible (no scrollbars if content fits) and scroll (scrollbars when content overflows). Ideal for creating scrollable containers only when needed. */

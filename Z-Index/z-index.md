# Z-Index  
- **The z-index property in CSS is used to control the stacking order of elements on a web page. It determines which elements should appear in front of or behind other elements when they overlap in the same space.**
- **Elements with higher z-index values are placed in front of elements with lower z-index values.**
- **Positioned Elements: To use z-index, an element must have a position value other than static (e.g., relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky). Positioned elements can be moved in the stacking order using z-index.**
- **Numeric Values:You can assign numeric values to z-index. Elements with higher numeric values will appear in front of elements with lower values.**
- **Negative Values:You can also use negative values for z-index. Elements with lower (more negative) values will appear in front of elements with higher (less negative) values.**

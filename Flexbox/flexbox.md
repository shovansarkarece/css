# FLEXBOX IN CSS
- **Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that helps you distribute space along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically) in a flexible and efficient way. It allows you to align and distribute elements within a container, making it easier to create complex layouts without using floats or positioning.**

# Graphical representation of main axis vs cross axis
- **Main Axis and Cross Axis:**
- **In a flex container, one axis is considered the main axis, and the other is the cross axis. You can set the main axis to be either horizontal (row) or vertical (column).**
